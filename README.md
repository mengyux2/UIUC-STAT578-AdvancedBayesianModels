# UIUC-STAT578-AdvancedBayesianModels
Assignments of STAT578

The goal of this course and assignments is to:

* Comprehend the implications of Bayes' rule and summaries of a Bayesian posterior distribution.
* Formulate appropriate Bayesian models, including data and prior distributions.
* Use R and JAGS for Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation.
* Assess Bayesian models through posterior predictive checking.
* Evaluate and compare Bayesian models.
* Apply hierarchical modeling and regression in a Bayesian framework.

This repository contains 7 assignments implemented using R in Jupyter notebook.
